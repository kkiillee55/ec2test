# ec2test

so basically, I'm following steps in recitation_2020_10_10_E6156

what I have learned:
1. write a simple application with flask
2. connect Pycharm and Github, push code form local IDE to Github, ctrl+shift+k to push to github
3. create AWS EC2 instance and clone Github repository to it, use export to set environment variables
4. create AWS RDS MYSQL instance, and connect Cloud database with both local MYSQL workbench and flask_sqlalchemy+pymysql
